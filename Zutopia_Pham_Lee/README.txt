In this project you will implement a simple, 2-D graphical, single-player arcade game and thereby gain experience in event-driven programming, while simultaneously exercising good object-oriented design skills. 
To implement the graphical user interface in this project, we will be using the JavaFX library. (Note: you must use this library in this project so that we can grade everyone's code fairly.) JavaFX is a large and somewhat complex library that requires understanding of event-handling (not too difficult) and multiple coordinate systems (somewhat more difficult). To keep the project tractable, we are giving you some code to help you get started in manipulating the graphics objects you will need to implement the game.
