In this project you will develop software instructure to model large graphs along with a search engine to find shortest paths between any pair of nodes in a graph. As an example application illustrating how to use this infrastructure, you will develop a search engine for the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) that allows users to find a shortest path of actor nodes and movie nodes that connect any two specified actors (if such a path exists). The code that your team will write to load data and find paths will interface with code (written by me) that implements the graphical user interface (GUI -- see figure below) of the application.
